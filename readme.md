# Data structures in golang.

This project I try to make popular data structures in golang. The data structures include:

1. Link Lists
2. Stacks and Queues
3. Trees
4. Graphs.

I will also try and implement some important algorithms like:
1. breadth first search
2. depth first search
3. graph travesal etc.


# Linked List

The implementation of linked list is simple.
1. single link list
2. does not store any value in the struct apart from reference to the first node in the list (HEAD)
3. All other operations are calculated each time we call a method

Here are the following methods implemented:

1. size() - give the size of the list
2. append() - appends a new node to the link list at the end of the list.
3. clear() - will remove all the elements from the link list.
4. average() - give the average of the value stored in the elements on the linked list. [this is relevant because the value stored in the list are int64]
