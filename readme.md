# Data structures in golang.

This project I try to make popular data structures in golang. The data structures include:

1. Link Lists
2. Stacks and Queues
3. Trees
4. Graphs.

I will also try and implement some important algorithms like:
1. breadth first search
2. depth first search
3. graph travesal etc.
